/* This a java Application which will comunicate each other.
To parform the comunication we use the consept of socket programing.

import java.net.* :- ServerSocket Class is used for providing system-independent implementation of the server-side of
                     client/server Socket Connection.

 Socket s :- it is a socket class object which is use to connect server socket.
 while creating this object we have pass two paramiter as the IP address of Server & the Port Number of the Server Application.
 in this code us used  to only education parps
